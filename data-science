STEPS FOR MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

1. Problem Definition
    "what problem are we trying to solve?" -> supervised, unsupervised, classification , regression.

2. Data
    "What kind of data do we have ?" -> structured{rows, colums}, unstructured{images, audio}

3. Evaluation
    "define what success means to us?" -> e.g 96% accuracy

4. Features
    "what do we already know about the data"

5. Modelling
    "Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?"

6. Experimentation
    "How could we improve / what can we try next?"


Main types of machine LEARNING
1. Supervised learning
    a. classification -> "is this one thing or the other" { binary classification, multi class classification}
    b. regression -> "Trying to predict a number"

2. unsupervised learning
    a. clustering

3. Transfer learning
    "leveraging what one machine model has learnt in another machine learning"

4.    Reinforcement learning


Certainly! Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. The process of machine learning can be broken down into several key components:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The first step in machine learning is to gather relevant and representative data. The quality and quantity of the data play a crucial role in the performance of the machine learning model.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Raw data often needs to be cleaned, formatted, and transformed before it can be used for training a machine learning model. This step involves handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and other data preparation tasks.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming the input variables (features) to improve the model's performance. This can include creating new features, selecting relevant ones, or transforming existing features.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Choosing the right type of machine learning model is crucial. The selection depends on the nature of the problem, the type of data, and the desired output. Common types of models include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and more.

5. **Model Training:**
   - In this step, the selected model is fed with the training data to learn the patterns and relationships within the data. The model adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - After training, the model needs to be evaluated using a separate set of data that it has never seen before (validation or test set). Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and more, depending on the type of problem (classification, regression, etc.).

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model is essential for improving its performance. Hyperparameters are configuration settings that are not learned during training and need to be set beforehand.

8. **Model Deployment:**
   - Once the model has been trained and evaluated successfully, it can be deployed for making predictions on new, unseen data. Deployment involves integrating the model into a production environment where it can be used to make real-world decisions.

9. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that the model performs well over time. If the performance degrades or the underlying data distribution changes, the model may need to be retrained or updated.

10. **Iterative Process:**
    - Machine learning is often an iterative process. Models may need to be refined, retrained, and improved based on new data or changing requirements.

Understanding and implementing these steps in the machine learning pipeline is crucial for developing effective and robust models.
