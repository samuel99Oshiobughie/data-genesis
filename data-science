STEPS FOR MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

1. Problem Definition
    "what problem are we trying to solve?" -> supervised, unsupervised, classification , regression.

2. Data
    "What kind of data do we have ?" -> structured{rows, colums}, unstructured{images, audio}

3. Evaluation
    "define what success means to us?" -> e.g 96% accuracy

4. Features
    "what do we already know about the data"

5. Modelling
    "Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?"

6. Experimentation
    "How could we improve / what can we try next?"


Main types of machine LEARNING
1. Supervised learning
    a. classification -> "is this one thing or the other" { binary classification, multi class classification}
    b. regression -> "Trying to predict a number"

2. unsupervised learning
    a. clustering

3. Transfer learning
    "leveraging what one machine model has learnt in another machine learning"

4.    Reinforcement learning
