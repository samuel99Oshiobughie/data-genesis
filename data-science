STEPS FOR MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

1. Problem Definition
    "what problem are we trying to solve?" -> supervised, unsupervised, classification , regression.

2. Data
    "What kind of data do we have ?" -> structured{rows, colums}, unstructured{images, audio}

3. Evaluation
    "define what success means to us?" -> e.g 96% accuracy

4. Features
    "what do we already know about the data"

5. Modelling
    "Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?"

6. Experimentation
    "How could we improve / what can we try next?"
